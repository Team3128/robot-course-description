# Robot Java Class
In recent years, it has become clear that, with bi-weekly meetings, we *cannot* teach people with no Java experiance how to code for the robot in a single year, so we have split our programming courses into two levels.  The first level teaches basic java at about the same level as the school's AP Computer Science course, and the second course builds on this knowledge and teaches people how to write Java on the robot.

Even with this division, class time is still short for the amount you are expected to learn.  So, we expect all students to try and write programs on their own time.  Trust me, you will learn a huge amount by doing this.

We will also give students from both courses plenty of practice in the form of weekly coding challenges.  Additionally, students in course 2 will work on the robot code during (and before) build season, and course 1 students will have several, non-robot java projects to do such as the scouting app.

## Requirements for the Course

We only have five or six computers total for programmers to share.  If you have your own laptop (or desktop [:)](https://xkcd.com/541/), we ask you to please bring it to meetings.

### AP Computer Science
If you have taken AP CompSci, you should already know everything that you need to take the second course.
### Everyone Else
If you have not taken AP Computer Science, in order to learn java for the robot, you need to understand intermediate Java and the Eclipse IDE. 

In general, you should be fine if you can do these things:
* Use Git and Github
* Write objects, functions, and constructors
* Write mathematical formuli in Java
* Write comments on the code you have written
* Use the internet and StackOverflow to find the answers to programming questions
* Use inheritance and interfaces
* Use generic containers (e.g. ArrayList and HashMap)
* Set up Eclipse and Java
* Debug code by printing to the standard output
* Understand primitive and object types and typecasting

## Topics Covered

### Advanced Java
* Multithreading
* Generics
* Design Patterns
* More to come

### Programming on the Robot
We will teach you about the robot (WPILib) Java API, as well as our code and our testing environment.  By the end, you will be able to write programs that can actually be used in competition.
